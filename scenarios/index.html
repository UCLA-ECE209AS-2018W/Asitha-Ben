	<h2>Attacks this System Prevents</h2>
	<p>
		This system prevents the impersonation of a joining node through encryption and singatures.
	</p>
	<p>
		If one node has faulty member information, the consensus system would still not allow a new node to join, since that faulty node
		will check with it's two adjacent nodes and lose majority confirmation. Given this check with two other nodes, we can say that up to 1/3 of the nodes can be compromised and
		the system could still work if ideally organized.
	</p>
	<p>
		Injection of faulty information could only be accomplished if the entire blockchain was recalculated. This functionality doesn't exist
		and furthermore, data falsification for transactions is prevented as well.
