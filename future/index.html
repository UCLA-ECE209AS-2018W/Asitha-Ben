  	<h2>Improvements</h2>
	<p>
		There are three main areas important for the improvement of our system: data normalization/pre-processing, additional neural network training/parameter tuning, and sensor placement/ambient light isolation.
</p>
	<p>
As discussed in the results section, our model is very sensitive to PPG wave range, which can vary based on the sensor and the subject. This suggests that normalization of all data (training and testing) prior to training can lead to more stability. In addition, the noise in the PPG signal can also lead to overfitting of the model. We are using Bayesian regularization to counter this, and change in delay may counter it as well, but filtering and smoothing may aid the process. In addition, filtering and smoothing may also allow for the use of training methods faster than Bayesian regularization. Processing may also lead to the discovery of new features that can be integrated with the NANN to provide more insight into the PPG/ABP correlation.
</p>
	<p>
Machine learning methods are highly dependent on large quantities of labeled data. While we obtained a large amount of data from the MIMIC III dataset, time constraints did not allow for training and parameter tuning use all of it. Ideally, out of 50 sets, 35 sets should be used exclusively for training and parameter tuning. For each combination of delay and number of hidden neurons, all 35 sets should be used to compute the model. At the end of this process, the minimum average MSE (training and testing) will determine the optimal delay and number of hidden neurons.
</p>

Sensor placement and ambient light isolation is something that can be improved upon as well. Clinical fingertip and wrist PPG sensors fit tightly to the finger or wrist, and can be adjusted to each subject. Our system used an adjustable band, but required the subject to hold down the sensor to allow for proper readings. This causes errors in both placement and ambient light exposure, which we saw to affect performance during testing. For our system, which is extremely sensitive to PPG signal quality and range, improving the hardware and sensor placement method can lead to significant model prediction improvements.
