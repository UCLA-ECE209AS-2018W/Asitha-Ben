	<h1>Conclusions</h1>
	<p>
		As mentioned in the introduction, one of the primary purposes of this project was to address the efficacy of blockchain in a closed-network IoT setting. After gaining some experience with this topic and exploring the underlying mechanisms this entails, we have come to the conclusion that blockchain does not add significant benefits to the network that could not be implemented with a secure distributed ledger, while also adding additional computational complexity and memory requirements.
	</p>
	<p>
		Blockchain technology is inherently suited to open network, transaction-related systems. Within this system, it allows for any member node to have equal permissions, and therefore equal trust within the network. When it comes to a private network, it is required that some nodes have more permission than others, in order to faciliate membership permissions. This centralizes power within the network, and makes the blockchain decentralization efforts redundant on top of the ledger stored with the trusted party, adding little to trust and security.
	</p>
	<h1>Future Work</h1>	
  	<h2>Blockchain Validation</h2>
	<p>
	Immutability won't matter in this network context if only one device has the immutable data. Since each device has its own chain, a true blockchain validation scheme will need to be implemented.
	We could implement resource-rich trusted nodes, each having their own blockchain of devices under their control. This way the nodes could distribute and share information, and keep track of the performance/security of a small network of sensors and actuators underneath them.
	Also a scheme for periodic reporting and recording of block hashes would be a benificial supplement.
	</p>
	<h2>Distributed Permissioning</h2>
	<p>
	Implementing device discovery would make it easier to add a device to the network if it is near, and building on the distributed permissioning system
	would allow every node in the network to know whicih nodes have which permissions for verification purposes. This implementation would require us to add new query and response functions/chord messages.
	</p>
	<h2>Embedded Viability</h2>
	<p>
	The system as it stands is viable on many embedded platforms, even medium-sized ones. Since our blockchain only records critical transactions, it won't use much memory from the devices since the memory storage size of the hashes are relatively small.
		We have tested the system on beaglebones, and it was shown to be reliable.
		For a true blockchain implementation with a significant amount of validation and immutability, more resources must be available for the network. Mining also plays an important role in standard blockchains and will need a more robust implementation.
