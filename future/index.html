	<h1>Future Work</h1>	
  	<h2>Blockchain Validation</h2>
	<p>
	Immutability won't matter in this network context if only one device has the immutable data. Since each device has its own chain, a true blockchain validation scheme will need to be implemented.
	We could implement resource-rich trusted nodes, each having their own blockchain of devices under their control. This way the nodes could distribute and share information, and keep track of the performance/security of a small network of sensors and actuators underneath them.
	Also a scheme for periodic reporting and recording of block hashes would be a benificial suppement.
	</p>
	<h2>Distributed Permissioning</h2>
	<p>
	Implementing device discovery would make it easier to add a device to the network if it is near, and building on the distributed permissioning system
	would allow every node in the network to know whicih nodes have which permissions for verification purposes. This implementation would require us to add new query and response functions/chord messages.
	</p>
	<h2>Embedded Viability</h2>
	<p>
	The system as it stands is viable on many embedded platforms, even medium-sized ones. Since our blockchain only records critical transactions, it won't use much memory from the devices since the memory storage size of the hashes are relatively small.
		We have tested the system on beaglebones, and it was shown to be reliable.
		For a true blockchain implementation with a significant amount of validation and immutability, more resources must be available for the network. Mining also plays an important role in standard blockchains and will need a more robust implementation.
