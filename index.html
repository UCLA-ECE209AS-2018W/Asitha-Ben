	<h1>Blockchain Framework for Internet of Things</h1>
	<h2>Project Summary</h2>
	<p>Our goal is to build a blockchain framework (based off Flowchain) for an IoT network, while ensuring security and stability.</p>
	<p>
	To do this, we learned how Flowchain works, and added a few features to increase the functionality of the framework, while adding security
		within the network to protect it from adversarial attacks.
