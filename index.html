  <h1>Blockchain Framework for Internet of Things</h1>
  
  <h2>Motivations</h2>

  <h3>P2P Vulnerabilities</h3>
  <p> 
    The prime motivation for this project was addressing the security risk inherent to P2P networks that a single node being compromised, in order to alter data or for imitation by a malicious actor, can wreak havoc on the rest of the network. At the same time our solution addresses malicious actors attempting to join a private network as if they were an insider. For instance, in a home security system, if an outside IoT device managed to convince a single critical network node that it had permission to unlock the front door, all security on all other nodes can do nothing to prevent it. By adding the blockchain element to the system, a network with heavy amounts of redundancy and immutability, as well as a secure consensus system, can ensure the performance of the security layers as long as a majority of the nodes are uncompromised. 
  </p>

  <h3>IoT Vulnerabilities</h3>
  <p>
    The risks that come along with the use of a P2P network are made even more likely through the use of IoT and embedded devices, which are often unsecured and prime targets for attack. Many devices are connected to the network and out of sight of any supervision, with unmitigated physical access points such as usb and JTAG ports, as well as weakly protected network access points. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by holes in the existing security layer on the device, such as weak or nonexistent authentication and encryption, and often old firmware that has not been patched for discovered exploits.
  </p>
  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    Blockchain technology hasnâ€™t been thoroughly evaluated for use in embedded systems, primarily due to resource constraints. The significant challenges that we focus on are the data size of the blockchain and the expense of cryptography. Devices on the network might not have enough memory space to store a large data ledger. In addition, high traffic networks tend to be expensive time wise since all the messages between nodes need to be encrypted. These challenges are addressed in this project.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Summary</h2>
  
  <p>
    Our goal for this project is to address some of these concerns by building a blockchain framework (based off Flowchain) for an IoT network, while ensuring security and stability.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to implement this system, we dove into the inner components of Flowchain to explore how it works, and added a few features to increase the functionality of the framework and ensure security within the network. We stressed keeping the system simple and lightweight enough to reliably run on embedded devices, while also adding significant layers of verification and authentication. Our main contributions to this project were reformatting the network structure itself in order to create a private IoT blockchain network that is capable of securely managing membership in a home or industrial setting.
