title: Countinuous Blood Pressure Monitoring using PPG

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring using PPG</h1>
	<h2>Project Summary</h2>
	<p>Our goal is to design a wrist-band with attachments that can successfully monitor userâ€™s blood pressure using single or dual-point photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveforms without a constant heart reference.</p>
	<p>
	To do this, we trained and implemented a neural network onto a Raspberry Pi 3 which took in real time PPG waveforms using a heart
	rate sensor and returned the patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure values.
